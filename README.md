# Breast-Cancer-Classification-and-Detection-Location
This study focuses on classifying if the cancer is malignant or benign and the proposed method detects the location if present. Three datasets: Ultrasound Images, Histopathological Images, and Mammography Images are used. DenseNet 169 proved to be the most effective classifier for the Ultrasound dataset, achieving high accuracy. The
Mask R-CNN algorithm was applied to detect the cancer location. For the Histopathology dataset, a CNN model was used for Multi-class classification, and Patch Detection algorithm was used to locate the cancer. The Mammography dataset utilized many Deep Learning models, with the VGG model performing the best. The Patch Detection technique was employed to detect and highlight the cancerâ€™s location.
